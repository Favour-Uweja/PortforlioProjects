# COVID-19 Data Analysis

This repository contains SQL queries designed to extract and analyze data from the COVID-19 dataset, focusing on death tolls, population impacts, and vaccination efforts. The goal is to provide a deeper understanding of how the pandemic has affected different regions and the progress of vaccination campaigns.

## Dataset

**Source of Dataset**: https://shorturl.at/bdpCN
owid - Our World in Data (`owid-covid-data`) 

The queries are based on the `owid-covid-data` dataset, which includes detailed information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations worldwide. The dataset is split into two main tables:
- `owid-covid-dataDeath`: Contains data related to COVID-19 deaths.
- `owid-covid-dataVac`: Contains data related to COVID-19 vaccinations.

## Queries

1. **Whole Data of Covid 19 Deaths**: Returns all records from the death data table.
2. **Maximum Death Count For Each Country**: Calculates the highest number of deaths in each country and the percentage of the population that has died due to COVID-19.
3. **Country with Highest Death Toll per Continent**: Identifies the country with the highest COVID-19 death toll on each continent.
4. **Continental Mortality**: Summarizes total deaths by continent.
5. **Comparing Continent-Specific Death Counts and Percentages**: Analyzes death counts and percentages across different continents, correlating with population and wealth demographics.
6. **Global COVID-19 Stats**: Shows global totals for cases and deaths, ordered by date.
7. **Combining COVID-19 Deaths and Vaccination Data**: Provides a comprehensive analysis by combining death and vaccination data.
8. **Examining Total Population in Relation to Cumulative New Vaccinations**: Uses both common table expressions and temporary tables to calculate cumulative vaccination percentages.

## Setup

To run these queries, ensure you have access to a SQL Server or any SQL-compatible database environment, download the data set from: https://shorturl.at/bdpCN 
where the `owid-covid-data` dataset is hosted. Import the data accordingly, and execute the SQL scripts contained in this repository.
